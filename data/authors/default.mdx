### Hi there! 👋

I'm a front-end developer who turns coffee into code and bugs into features. 🚀✨    

🔭 I’m currently working on making the web a better place, one pixel at a time.   
🌱 I’m learning how to balance perfect designs with practical implementation.    
💬 Ask me about how I survived JavaScript's quirks and came out stronger.
